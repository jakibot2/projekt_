        <h1>Our work</h1>
        <article>
            <p>We are a group that strives on a daily basis to reduce the carbon footprint of our school (Gimnazije Vi훾)
                and thereby
                we are slowly moving towards a cleaner future. Our group consists of 9 members of the 2nd year.</p>

            <h3>Energy consumption</h3>

            <p> We started the project with a research based on finding out
                electricity and gas savings of the school. We focused mainly on heating and found that
                we use the most gas and electricity in January, which can be explained by the low temperatures and the
                need for
                heating. School lighting probably also contributes to this. Because our electricity comes from
                of several sources, we want to show you the share of energy that is obtained with the help of nuclear
                and fossil resources
                of fuels and renewable resources (an interesting fact is that the use of renewable resources has
                increased in the last two years
                increased by as much as 6.1%) :</p>

            The composition of electricity sources is approximately:
            <ul>
                <li>57% fossil fuels</li>
                <li>25% nuclear</li>
                <li>18% renewable energy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you want to know more about energy consumption at GimVi훾, go to the Energy tab or click <a
                    href="energy.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Energy efficiency</h3>

            <p>After we collected data on gas and electricity consumption, we began to wonder about the quality of the
                school
                insulation. We checked this with the help of an infrared camera and found that the school is doing well
                in most parts
                insulated, and the problem is the wall next to the small gym, which is thermally poorly insulated, but
                it is
                we must not replace it, as it is culturally protected. After a few weeks of collecting data, we just
                reviewed them
                and written in the form of several graphs.</p>

            <h3>Transport to school</h3>
            <p>Since students from the wider area are also educated at the Vi훾 Gymnasium, the use of private vehicles
                and public transport is limited
                traffic something everyday. We asked ourselves the question of how much carbon dioxide is released into
                the environment
                average student by driving to and from school, and came to the answer of 800 grams, which means that
                every day
                students release around 600 kg of CO2 emissions.
