        <h1>What is energy?</h1>
        <article>
            <p>There are different definitions of energy, but they all have a common conclusion: energy is the ability
                of a system and body to do the work.</p>

            <p>The basic unit for measuring energy is the joule. In the household we use the unit <i>kilowatt hour</i>
                (1 kWh, which corresponds to work done by a consumer with a power of 1 kW in one hour). It is a physical
                unit for work and energy (1 KWh is equal to 3.6 MJ). The unit of energy is also <i>toe</i> (ton of oil
                equivalent, strangely not a "freedom" unit), which means quantity energy, which is released by burning 1
                ton of crude oil. Toe is used to indicate large amounts of energy (1 toe = 41.87 GJ = 11.63 MWh).</p>

            <p>Energy is needed in everyday life to prepare and store food, for hot water, for maintenance of suitable
                living conditions (heating, cooling), for driving means of transport, for
                entertainment, etc.</p>

            In energetics, we know the forms of energy, which are characterized according to the degree of conversion
            from forms that are not
            we can directly use, in the ones we need (for example at home):
            <ul>
                <li><b>primary energy</b> (hidden in energy carriers),</li>
                <li><b>secondary energy</b> (e.g. electricity obtained from coal in a thermal power plant), </li>
                <li><b>final energy</b> (obtained by the user),</li>
                <li><b>useful energy</b> (to meet user needs, e.g. heat on an electric stove
                    panels).</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Why are we mentioning energy?</h2>

        <article>
            <p>As the figure below shows very clearly, energy is the main source of the carbon footprint. As much as
                &frac34 of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is caused by our use of energy.</p>

        <h1>Energy consumption at Vič Gymnasium</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Gimnazija Vič uses between 15 MWh and 20 MWh per month during the school year, of which we use the most
                in winter. After careful consideration we concluded that this is caused by greatery use of lights during
                the darker months. In total, we used <mark>194 MWh</mark> in one year. </p>
            <img class="slika" src="images/electricity_consumption.png" alt="Electricity consumption at GimVič">

            <p>Such consumption means emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> between 5000kg and 9000kg per month. That means within
                a year release into the atmosphere about <mark>80 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.</mark> This is compared to
                radioactive waste is a very large figure, as our electricity consumption resulted in only <mark>91
                    grams</mark> of radioactive waste.</p>

            <p>Best to just show you this graph:</p>

        <h2>Sources of electricity on gimvic</h2>
        <article>
            The composition of electricity sources is approximately:
            <ul>
                <li>57% fossil fuels</li>
                <li>25% nuclear</li>
                <li>18% renewable energy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of this, electricity produced by solar cells has increased the most in recent years: 2.5%
                (2021) >>> 8.6% (2023).</p>
